- High level overview
    - "Java is a blue collar language. It's not PhD thesis material, but a language for a job." - James Gosling
    - Not a single line of this codebase was AI generated, including all tests
    - Simplify Java code by relying on simple effective patterns that focus on composibility, as opposed to reusability)
    - This is NOT an FP library - please use https://vavr.io for that
- highly biased towards "prevent invalid states from being instantiatable"
    - use a tuple or builder for moving through "partial" states prior to instantiation
- highly biased towards reducing the use of null
    - no other meaning for null is allowed other than a reference has not-yet-initialized
    - is filtered out (typically as a flatMap) everywhere it is encountered
    - it is considered a compile-time type hole, and is biased towards run-time errors
    - use Optional or Either to compile-time handle alternatives
- highly biased towards encapsulating checked exception
    - biases to error-by-value (via an Either), as opposed to error-by-throw-exception
    - all functionality is assumed to be RuntimeException; i.e. no checked exception signatures
    - use Either.tryCatchChecked to conveniently wrap all checked exceptions
- highly biased towards using expressions, as opposed to statements
    - encapsulates iteration statements into Stream patterns
    - encapsulates exception handling try/catch statements into the Either.tryCatch* patterns
    - encapsulates resource handling with try statements into the Using.apply patterns
    - encapsulates if statements into ADTs, Optional, Either, etc.
- offers both types of "instantiation" factory
    - unsafeFrom which throws an exception if preconditions fail
    - from which returns an Either where the left contains the exception that would have been thrown when the
      precondition fails
